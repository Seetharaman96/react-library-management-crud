            A library is a collection of materials, books or media that are
            accessible for use and not just for display purposes. A library
            provides physical (hard copies) or digital access (soft copies)
            materials, and may be a physical location or a virtual space, or
            both. A library's collection can include printed materials and other
            physical resources in many formats such as DVD, CD and cassette and
            well access to information, music or other content held on
            bibliographic databases.
            <br />A library, which may vary widely in size, may be organized for
            use and maintained by a public body such as a government; an
            institution such as a school or museum; a corporation; or a private
            individual. In addition to providing materials, libraries also
            provide the services of librarians who are trained and experts at
            finding, selecting, circulating and organizing information and at
            interpreting information needs, navigating and analyzing very large
            amounts of information with a variety of resources.

            Library buildings often provide quiet areas for studying, as well as
            common areas for group study and collaboration, and may provide
            public facilities for access to their electronic resources; for
            instance: computers and access to the Internet. The library's
            clientele and services offered vary depending on its type: users of
            a public library have different needs from those of a special
            library or academic library, for example. Libraries may also be
            community hubs, where programs are delivered and people engage in
            lifelong learning. Modern libraries extend their services beyond the
            physical walls of a building by providing material accessible by
            electronic means, including from home via the Internet.
            <br />
            The services that libraries offer are variously described as library
            services, information services, or the combination "library and
            information services", although different institutions and sources
            define such terminology differently.

            The history of libraries began with the first efforts to organize
            collections of documents.[2] The first libraries consisted of
            archives of the earliest form of writing—the clay tablets in
            cuneiform script discovered in Sumer, some dating back to 2600 BC.
            Private or personal libraries made up of written books appeared in
            classical Greece in the 5th century BC. In the 6th century, at the
            very close of the Classical period, the great libraries of the
            Mediterranean world remained those of Constantinople and Alexandria.
            <br />
            The Fatimids (r. 909–1171) also possessed many great libraries
            within their domains. The historian Ibn Abi Tayyi’ describes their
            palace library, which probably contained the largest collection of
            literature on earth at the time, as a "wonder of the world".
            Throughout history, along with bloody massacres, the destruction of
            libraries has been critical for conquerors who wish to destroy every
            trace of the vanquished community's recorded memory. A prominent
            example of this can be found in the Mongol massacre of the Nizaris
            at Alamut in 1256 and the torching of their library, "the fame of
            which", boasts the conqueror Juwayni, "had spread throughout the
            world".[3]
